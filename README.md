# Intro

A working prototype for calling CVODE, as wrapped as a quench in pele from fortran code with a fortran potential energy function.

This contains a working prototype inserting a C++ function layer between fortran code, along with some other stuff I was playing around with. (The code in this in the process of being absorved into a separate repository)
